# UoScripts
Razor scripts for Ultima online on outlands


I've decided to create this repository to manage all the scripts i've made over time.

############# TRAINING #############
All script has been tested and has proven to work, while I've used them for my skills.
If you experience any problems with theese scripts - you're welcome to contact me on discord - as I'm 
controlling who can see this collection and who cannot - you should know who I am :)



############# UTILITY #############
This is a collection of scripts to make UO life easier.






############# COOLDOWNS #############
Alot of the handling for cooldowns was inspired by this following link:
https://gist.github.com/tstenhaug/7b8a8205da3d11d3a41ecabc354db746#file-wizardry-nuke-with-cooldowns-razor-L232

For cooldowns, there will be 2 files in most cases - a razor script and a xml entry for your 
cooldowns.xml file located under your profile.
So make sure that you have both the xml and .razor macro for the cooldown you desire.
